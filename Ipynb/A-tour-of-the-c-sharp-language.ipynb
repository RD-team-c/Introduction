    "# A tour of the C# language\n",
    "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/\n",
    "\n",
    "C# (pronounced \"See Sharp\") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. This tour provides an overview of the major components of the language in C# 8 and earlier. If you want to explore the language through interactive examples, try the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/\">introduction to C# tutorials</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "C# is an object-oriented, <b>component-oriented</b> programming language. C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components. Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices. At its core, C# is an <b>object-oriented</b> language. You define types and their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several C# features help create robust and durable applications. <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/\">Garbage collection</a> automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects. <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references\">Nullable types</a> guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects. <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/exceptions/\">Exception handling</a> provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery. <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-expressions\">Lambda expressions</a> support functional programming techniques. Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax creates a common pattern for working with data from any source. Language support for <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/'>asynchronous operations</a> provides syntax for building distributed systems. C# has a <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/'>unified type system</a>. All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root object type. All types share a set of common operations. Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/reference-types'>reference types</a> and <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-types'>value types</a>. C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures. C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance. C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "C# emphasizes <b>versioning</b> to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner. Aspects of C#'s design that were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate virtual and override modifiers, the rules for method overload resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations."

    "C# programs run on .NET, a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a set of class libraries. The CLR is the implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure (CLI), an international standard. The CLI is the basis for creating execution and development environments in which languages and libraries work together seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source code written in C# is compiled into an <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code\">intermediate language (IL)</a> that conforms to the CLI specification. The IL code and resources, such as bitmaps and strings, are stored in an assembly, typically with an extension of .dll. An assembly contains a manifest that provides information about the assembly's types, version, and culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the C# program is executed, the assembly is loaded into the CLR. The CLR performs Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to convert the IL code to native machine instructions. The CLR provides other services related to automatic garbage collection, exception handling, and resource management. Code that's executed by the CLR is sometimes referred to as \"managed code.\" \"Unmanaged code,\" is compiled into native machine language that targets a specific platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language interoperability is a key feature of .NET. IL code produced by the C# compiler conforms to the Common Type Specification (CTS). IL code generated from C# can interact with code that was generated from the .NET versions of F#, Visual Basic, C++. There are more than 20 other CTS-compliant languages. A single assembly may contain multiple modules written in different .NET languages. The types can reference each other as if they were written in the same language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the run time services, .NET also includes extensive libraries. These libraries support many different workloads. They're organized into namespaces that provide a wide variety of useful functionality. The libraries include everything from file input and output to string manipulation to XML parsing, to web application frameworks to Windows Forms controls. The typical C# application uses the .NET class library extensively to handle common \"plumbing\" chores.\n",

    "A type defines the structure and behavior of any data in C#. The declaration of a type may include its members, base type, interfaces it implements, and operations permitted for that type. A variable is a label that refers to an instance of a specific type.\n",
    "\n",

Variables of reference types store references to their data, the latter being known as objects. With reference types, it's possible for two variables to reference the same object and possible for operations on one variable to affect the object referenced by the other variable. With value types, the variables each have their own copy of the data, and it isn't possible for operations on one to affect the other (except for ref and out parameter variables).\n",

    "## Finalizers\n",
    "A finalizer is a member that implements the actions required to finalize an instance of a class. Typically, a finalizer is needed to release unmanaged resources. Finalizers can't have parameters, they can't have accessibility modifiers, and they can't be invoked explicitly. The finalizer for an instance is invoked automatically during garbage collection. For more information, see the article on finalizers.\n",

    "The garbage collector is allowed wide latitude in deciding when to collect objects and run finalizers. Specifically, the timing of finalizer invocations isn't deterministic, and finalizers may be executed on any thread. For these and other reasons, classes should implement finalizers only when no other solutions are feasible.\n",

    "## Expressions\n",
    "Expressions are constructed from operands and operators. The operators of an expression indicate which operations to apply to the operands. Examples of operators include +, -, *, /, and new. Examples of operands include literals, fields, local variables, and expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an expression contains multiple operators, the precedence of the operators controls the order in which the individual operators are evaluated. For example, the expression x + y * z is evaluated as x + (y * z) because the * operator has higher precedence than the + operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an operand occurs between two operators with the same precedence, the associativity of the operators controls the order in which the operations are performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for the assignment and null-coalescing operators, all binary operators are left-associative, meaning that operations are performed from left to right. For example, x + y + z is evaluated as (x + y) + z.\n",
    "The assignment operators, the null-coalescing ?? and ??= operators, and the conditional operator ?: are right-associative, meaning that operations are performed from right to left. For example, x = y = z is evaluated as x = (y = z).\n",
    "Precedence and associativity can be controlled using parentheses. For example, x + y * z first multiplies y by z and then adds the result to x, but (x + y) * z first adds x and y and then multiplies the result by z.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most operators can be overloaded. Operator overloading permits user-defined operator implementations to be specified for operations where one or both of the operands are of a user-defined class or struct type.\n",

    "Declaration statements are used to declare local variables and constants.\n",
    "Expression statements are used to evaluate expressions. Expressions that can be used as statements include method invocations, object allocations using the new operator, assignments using = and the compound assignment operators, increment and decrement operations using the ++ and -- operators and await expressions.\n",
    "Selection statements are used to select one of a number of possible statements for execution based on the value of some expression. This group contains the if and switch statements.\n",
    "Iteration statements are used to execute repeatedly an embedded statement. This group contains the while, do, for, and foreach statements.\n",
    "Jump statements are used to transfer control. This group contains the break, continue, goto, throw, return, and yield statements.\n",
    "The try...catch statement is used to catch exceptions that occur during execution of a block, and the try...finally statement is used to specify finalization code that is always executed, whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "The checked and unchecked statements are used to control the overflow-checking context for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.\n",
    "The lock statement is used to obtain the mutual-exclusion lock for a given object, execute a statement, and then release the lock.\n",
    "The using statement is used to obtain a resource, execute a statement, and then dispose of that resource.\n",

    "### Garbage collection\n",
    "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/\n",
    ".NET's garbage collector manages the allocation and release of memory for your application. Each time you create a new object, the common language runtime allocates memory for the object from the managed heap. As long as address space is available in the managed heap, the runtime continues to allocate space for new objects. However, memory is not infinite. Eventually the garbage collector must perform a collection in order to free some memory. The garbage collector's optimizing engine determines the best time to perform a collection, based upon the allocations being made. When the garbage collector performs a collection, it checks for objects in the managed heap that are no longer being used by the application and performs the necessary operations to reclaim their memory.\n",
